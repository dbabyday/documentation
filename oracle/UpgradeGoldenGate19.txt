Your steps are fine. You could "reuse" Old GoldenGate setup/dir* files into the new install.

-------- here are some very high level steps for upgrading both source and target db/goldengate ---------
1-Stop the source and target application that connect to the source and target database.
2-Stop all the extracts process either by using a bounded recovery checkpoint or by specifying the LOGEND option.
3-Stop the Replicat processes and the manager.
4-Initiate the source and target database upgrade.
5-Install the 19c Golden gate binaries in the new directory by deselecting the Start Manager option.
6-Once the Soucre and target databases are upgraded proceed with the further steps.
7-Execute the ulg.sql script as sysdba in the source database.
8-Move the parameter file to the newly installed Golden Gate directory.
9-Start the manager, extract and replicat processes.
-------------

check #5 and #8.
