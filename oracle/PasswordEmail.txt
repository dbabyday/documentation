The JDE databases are protected at the network layer by ACLs. That means you will not be able to access the databases directly from your laptop. You can access this database using the Citrix Oracle SQL Developer app. If you do not have access to this application in your Citrix/Appstogo account, you can request it by:
        Service Catalog > Request an Account > Additional Accounts 
                - Account Action: Creation 
                - Application: OTHER APPLICATION 
                - Other Application not listed: Citrix Oracle SQL Developer

The temporary password is set as expired, so you will need to change it before you can connect to the database. You can do this in Oracle SQL Developer with the following steps. 

Create New Connection (if you do not have one saved)
1. Click the "+" symbol for a new connection (in the Connections pane on the left side)
2. Enter the details from the file downloaded
        a. Connection Name of your choice
        b. Username
        c. Password
        d. Hostname
        e. Port
        f. Service name
3. Click Save
        a. Note: You will not be able to "Test" or "Connect" at this point. Your password is expired, you will receive an error with those buttons.
4. Click Cancel

Reset the Password
1. Right-click on the connection (in the Connections pane on the left side)
2. Select "Reset Password..."
3. For "Current Password" enter the temporary password from the file downloaded
4. For "New Password" and "Confirm Password" enter a new password of your choice
5. Click "OK"
6. Double-click the connection to connect and open a new query worksheet
