DBA Dudes…

I’ve created a handy script that displays important shared memory info in a given zone:

/ops/bin/shm-mem.sh

Database user:  gloria
Proj shm-mem:   32768 MB  --> maximum amount of shared mem you can allocate based on the /etc/project file
Actual shm-mem: 14348 MB  --> what the oracle PIDs are currently consuming for shm-mem

This will give you a gage of free/utilized shared mem before you allocate your SGA and fire-up your databases.
