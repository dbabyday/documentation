Brent Ozar - How to Think Like the Engine

set statistics io on
set statistics time on -- not used often, but allows you to compare cpu time

check in execution plan operator details (hover over)
	Estimated Subtree Cost --> "query bucks"
	memory grant
	compare estimated number of rows to actual number of rows

Execution Plans
	Read Right to Left, Top to bottom
	Key Lookup --> find key in index then go look up the row by that key (inner join indexes)
		efficient for lower number of results
		expensive when there are lots of rows in result...may be better to scan clustered index (table) instead
		look at Key Lookup Output List --> if it is a small list of columns, add them to the index

Measure index size
	sp_BlitzIndex @TableName='Users';
	gives size in rows and MB
